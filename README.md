# tier-1-support-lab

Tier 1 IT support training lab using Linux (Ubuntu), CLI, JIRA, and scripting for realistic IT scenarios.

## About This Project

This project serves two main goals:

1. **Showcase my skills** in IT support, system administration, and scripting by building realistic, hands-on scenarios that demonstrate troubleshooting and problem-solving abilities.

2. **Provide a free, practical resource** for others who are learning or training in IT support, offering customizable scripts, documentation, and environments to practice with.

By sharing this work openly, I hope to contribute to a broader community of learners and professionals who want accessible tools to develop their skills and confidence.

## Overview

This project aims to simulate a realistic Tier 1 IT support environment to practice user account management, group permissions, access control, and issue triage.

## Project Components

- **User Directory:** A spreadsheet listing employees, roles, departments, and group memberships.  
- **Group Access Matrix:** Defines permissions for company resources by department and group.  
- **Ubuntu Server VM:** Virtual environment running Ubuntu Server 24.04.2 (latest) with users, groups, and folder permissions configured.  
- **Scripting:** Python scripts (in development) to simulate random permission changes and generate IT support tickets for troubleshooting practice.  
- **Issue Tracking:** JIRA board set up to manage simulated tickets and track progress.

## Tools Used

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) — for virtualization  
- [Ubuntu Server (latest)](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) — command-line interface (CLI)  
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) — for scripting  
- [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/free) — for ticket management  
- GitHub — for version control and documentation

## Future Plans

- Complete the Python ticket generator script. ✓
- Integrate more complex permissions and auditing tools.  
- Expand the lab with network services like Samba and log monitoring.
